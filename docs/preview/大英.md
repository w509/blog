# Passage One: Quantum Communication Breakthrough

Chinese University Confirms Feasibility of Establishing Space-To-Ground Quantum Communication Network

中国大学证实构建天地一体化量子通信网络的可行性

Scholars from a Chinese university and several research institutions published a thesis in British weekly scientific journal Nature that confirms the feasibility of establishing space-ground quantum communication work.

由中国科学技术大学联合多家科研机构学者在《自然》周刊发表的论文，证实了构建天地量子通信网络的可行性。

This lays the scientific and technological foundation for achieving a quantum communication network that covers the world.

这为建立覆盖全球的量子通信网络奠定了科学技术基础。

The thesis was published by scholars from the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) in partnership with research teams from Shanghai Institute of Technical Physics under Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Jinan Institute of Quantum Technology.

论文由中国科学技术大学学者联合中科院上海技术物理研究所、济南量子技术研究院研究团队共同完成。

The thesis is entitled An integrated space-to-ground quantum communication network over 4,600 kilometres, according to an article published on the official website of USTC.

根据中科大官网文章，论文题目为《跨越4600公里的天地一体化量子通信网络》。

According to the article, based on the connection of China's Beijing-Shanghai quantum communication network, the world's first quantum-encrypted network, and the Mozi satellite, the Chinese research groups demonstrate the world's first integrated space-to-ground quantum communication network over 4,600 kilometers that combines a large-scale fiber network of more than 700 fiber quantum key distribution (QKD) links and two high-speed satellite-to-ground free-space QKD links.

文章指出，基于全球首个量子加密网络"京沪干线"和"墨子号"卫星的天地连接，中国研究团队展示了首个4600公里级的天地一体化量子通信网络，整合了含700多个光纤量子密钥分发链路的大规模光纤网络和两条高速星地自由空间量子密钥分发链路。

According to the abstract of thesis, the QKD technique has the "potential to enable secure communication and information transfer," which is one of the most advanced features for quantum communication network.

论文摘要指出，量子密钥分发技术具有"实现安全通信和信息传输的潜力"，这是量子通信网络最先进的特征之一。

It also noted that the research staff have taken more than two years to conduct stability and safety tests on it, and proved that the Beijing-Shanghai quantum communication network can withstand all currently known quantum hacking methods and ensure cyber safety.

研究团队经过两年多的稳定性与安全性测试，证明京沪量子通信网络可抵御所有已知量子黑客攻击，确保网络安全。

The Beijing-Shanghai quantum communication network, opened in 2017, exceeds 2,000 kilometers in length, and covers 32 modes in four provinces and three cities.

2017年开通的京沪量子通信网络总长超2000公里，覆盖四省三市32个节点。

Four quantum MANs (metropolitan area network) in Beijing, Jinan, Hefei and Shanghai are connected by two ground satellite stations with the Mozi satellite.

北京、济南、合肥、上海四个量子城域网通过两个地面卫星站与墨子号卫星连接。

The network now has been applied over 150 users in finance, power and government administration.

该网络目前已应用于金融、电力和政府管理等领域的150余家用户。

At the beginning of 2019, the State Grid Corporation of China established a QKD channel spanning 2,600 kilometers from Beijing headquarters to State Grid Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region based on this network, which realized the encrypted transmission of power communication data and proved the feasibility of applying the network to real scenarios.

2019年初，国家电网基于该网络建成从北京总部至新疆的2600公里量子密钥分发通道，实现了电力通信数据的加密传输，验证了网络实际应用可行性。



# Passage Two: Capturing Light Speed

Here's What the Speed of Light Looks Like in Slow Motion

慢动作下的光速实拍

Light travels at 186,000 miles per second (300 million meters per second) and is believed to set the unsurpassable speed limit of the universe.

光速为每秒186,000英里（3亿米/秒），被认为是宇宙不可超越的速度极限。

But what does the speed of light actually look like?

但光速的实际运动轨迹究竟如何呈现？

CalTech researchers demonstrated their camera's capabilities by filming a laser beam passing through a bottle of milk at about 100 billion frames per second.

加州理工学院研究人员通过每秒1000亿帧的超高速相机，拍摄激光束穿过牛奶瓶的过程展示其摄像能力。

In the resulting footage, photons clearly streak through the milk in a blue blur as the laser travels across the screen from left to right.

视频显示，光子以蓝色模糊轨迹在牛奶中穿行，激光从左至右扫过屏幕。

Milk molecules helped scatter the photons in the laser beam, similar to how clouds of cosmic dust scatter the light from otherwise-invisible stars.

牛奶分子帮助散射激光束中的光子，其原理类似宇宙尘埃云散射不可见恒星的光线。

The light traveled through the length of the bottle in about 2,000 picoseconds, or 2 billionths of a second.

光线穿越整个奶瓶耗时约2000皮秒，即二十亿分之一秒。

Known as T-CUP, the camera was first described in an October 2018 paper in the journal Light: Science and Applications and is reportedly capable of photographing light at 10 trillion frames per second.

这款名为T-CUP的相机首次发表于2018年10月《光：科学与应用》期刊，据称能以每秒10万亿帧捕捉光运动。

The researchers developed T-CUP for the express purpose of filming ultrashort laser pulses in incredible detail.

研究人员开发T-CUP的明确目标是实现超短激光脉冲的极致细节拍摄。

Unlike prior streak cameras, the T-CUP is able to image an entire laser pulse in a single frame by diverting the laser beam to two different cameras simultaneously.

不同于传统条纹相机，T-CUP通过将激光束分至两个相机同步成像，实现单帧完整记录激光脉冲。

CalTech professor Lihong Wang revealed researchers may soon develop a camera capable of recording 1 quadrillion frames per second.

加州理工学院教授王立宏透露，研究人员可能很快开发出每秒1千万亿帧的相机。



# Passage Three: AI Strategic Imperative

Why Every Business Owner Should Adopt An AI Approach

企业为何必须采用人工智能战略

VMware CEO Pat Gelsinger emphasizes data at scale (from 30 billion sensors) and cloud computing power are driving AI evolution.

VMware首席执行官Pat Gelsinger强调，来自300亿传感器的规模化数据和云计算能力正推动AI发展。

He warns companies not investing in AI will lose competitiveness, citing an example where AI-adopting Company A achieves 10% annual efficiency gains versus 2% for traditional Company B.

他警告不投资AI的企业将丧失竞争力，举例说明采用AI的A公司年效率提升10%，而传统B公司仅2%。

Silicon Valley investor Jim Breyer describes the U.S.-China AI race, noting China's leadership in facial recognition and U.S. strengths in IoT and machine learning.

硅谷投资人Jim Breyer描述中美AI竞赛，指出中国在面部识别领先，美国在物联网和机器学习占优。

Breyer emphasizes the "innovation pipeline" between Silicon Valley and Asia is crucial for maintaining technological leadership.

Breyer强调硅谷与亚洲的"创新通道"对保持技术领导力至关重要。

The article concludes that leveraging cross-border innovation ecosystems is essential for business survival in the AI era.

文章结论指出，利用跨境创新生态系统是AI时代企业生存的关键。
